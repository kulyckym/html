You can let web browsers know that you are using HTML by starting your document with a document type declaration.
The declaration looks like this: <!DOCTYPE html>   and it must be the first line of code in all html documents.
To create HTML structure and content, you must add opening and closing <html> tags
You need o have an opening tab and closing tab for your html text.
The <head> element contains the metadata for a web page. Metadata is information about the page that isn't displayed directly on the web page. You'll see an example of this in the next exercise.
always close ellements (ex. <title>BOTTOM TEXT <title>)
The line break element <br /> is one example of a self-closing tag, which can split a scentence.
HTML documents are organized as a collection of parent-child relationships. When an element is contained inside another element, it is considered the child of that element.
White space makes your code easier to read and you can identify elements easier.
Always indent twice to make code neater and this double indent is the standard for html coding.
Comments begin with <!-- and end with -->. Any characters in between will be ignored by the browser.
