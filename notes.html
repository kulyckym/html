      <p> this is how you write a paragraph using opening anclosing paragraph tags </p>
<!-- if you want the code that you are writing to show up on your site, use the <body>-->
       <body>
        <h1> This is a header, It is used to show text on a website </h1>
        <h2> This is an h2, it appears smaller than an h1 </h2>
        <h3> This is an h3, which is smaller than a h2. This cycle of headers continue getting smaller and smaller</h3>
          <p>The line break element "<br />" is one example of a self-closing tag, which can split a scentence. <br>
HTML documents are organized as a collection of parent-child relationships. When an element is contained inside another element, it is considered the child of that element.<br>        
White space makes your code easier to read and you can identify elements easier.
          <p>
        <h3> Indentation </h3>
            <p>Always indent twice to make code neater and this double indent is the standard for html coding.
            </p> 
        <h4> Comments begin with <!-- and end with -->. Any characters in between will be ignored by the browser.</h4>
        <p>You can style your text as <em>italic</em> or <strong>bold</strong><p>
<p>To create a list of items in no particular order,(so there are no numbers before the list item) use the ul tag </p>
         <p>To add an item to this unordered list, use the li tag </p>
          <ul>
            <li>This is the first point on the list</li>
            <li>This is the second point on the list</li>
            <li>This is the third point on the list, etc, etc</li>
            <ol>
			<li> point one </li>
			<li> point 2 </li>

		  <p>You can turn an image or video into a link by wrapping it in an anchor, (a)</p>
		  <p>For example:</p>
			 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear" target="_blank">   
    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/web-101/web101-image_brownbear.jpg" />

		  <h3> CSS Coding </h3>
		  <p> Css is used to style font either in html or in a sperate html <p>
		  <p> You can override a tag with a class, and a class with an ID, as it is more specific. </p>
		  <p class=".blu"> The following text is styled via a linked seperate css file</p>
		  <p class=".yel"> You can seperate your css code from your html code, and can apply the css to the html by using the id element.</p>	
		  <p class=".blu"> CSS can select HTML elements by their tag, class, and ID. CSS classes and IDs have different purposes, which can affect which one you use to style HTML elements.</p>
		  <p class=".yel"> To create a table use the table element and to add rows use the tr element </p>
		  <p class=".blu"> To define a table row use the table define element (td) </p>
		  <p> You can also define and style all headers or paragraphs by "chaining" by doing h1.nameoftag{style}. All of the h1
		     elements will be styled in maroon cursive writing. </p>
		  <p> the css element that overrides all other elements is the !imporant element which can be given to describe a very 
			  specific attribute and is very hard to override.</p>
		  <p> In CSS, to avoid repetitiveness in code, you can style two attributes with the same stylying by using a coma (,).
			  For example: instead of "h1 { font-family: Georgia;}.menu {font-family: Georgia;}", you can do 
		  h1, .menu {font-family: Georgia;}, and the font faimily gerogia will be applied to both h1 and .menu</p>
		  <p> To style text: font-size  (measured in pixels, px), font-family (the type of font), font-weight (the boldness of the text (bold or normal) can be used.</p>
		  <p> You can also align texts using the text-align element in CSS, by either choosingright, left or center.</p>
		  <p> Color can affect the following design aspects: Foreground color and Background color </p>
		  <p> It is pretty self explanatory, as foreground color (color) will change the font color, while background color
			  affects (background-color) affects the color of the background of the paragraph or heading.</p>
		  <p> Opacity (opacity:) is the measure of how transparent an element is. It's measured from 0 to 1, with 1 representing 100%, 
			  or fully visible and opaque, and 0 representing 0%, or fully invisible.</p>
		  <h2 class=".marcus"> CSS: THE BOX MODEL </h2>
		  <p> The box model in css  comprises the set of properties which define parts of an element that take up space on a web page.</p>
		  <p> The model includes the content area's size (width and height) and the element's padding, border, and margin. </p>
		  <p> Here is an example of a box model.</p>
		  <img src="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/images/boxdim.png"/>
		  <p> You can set the height and width by using (height:) and (width:) followed by a numberical value in pixels (px). </p>
		  <p> All aspects and values of a box model are coded in a seperate css file linked to an html document.</p>
		  <h2 class=.sborder> This is a CSS Border </h2>
		  <p> A border is a line that surrounds an element, like a frame around a painting. Borders can be set with a specific width, style, and color. </p>
		  <p> The width can be set to be either thin, medium or thick. The style can be set to either solid, dotted or none. The color can be chosen and changed.</p>
		  <p> Example: p{ border: 3px solid blue; }
		  <p> You can modify the corners of an element's border box with the border-radius property. </p>
